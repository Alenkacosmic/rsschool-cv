## A bit about me
Let’s turn to real side: actively join new projects, strongly take on tasks and, not paying attention to time, build up processes - really my favorite period of any activity: when you are in crazy rush need to find problem itself, find reasons, instruments, resources... when you from day to day work on your "child" seeing what is going well and what should be edited, spending all your time including dreams. i love to wake up with solution or new ways how to find it. 
And finally you see how you project is living its life and you find out that there is too much free time, everything is on its way and you feel a bit bored. So, here it goes: time for new adventure!
